This section outlines templates that projects funded by Octant should use when participating in Octant funding and be sharing on the Octant Discuss Forum (opens new window). Templates include:

Project proposal template: This template should be used when first making a submission to Octant and the project has made it through the eligibility check.
Short-term reporting template: This short-term update template is for the subsequent epoch a project's participating in after initial submission. For example, if your first epoch participated in was Epoch Four and you're now participating in Epoch Five, you would use this template.
Long-term reporting template: This long-term update template is the main template for reporting and should be used for projects where it's been 2 or more epochs since their initial application. For example, your project was first submitted in Epoch Three and it's now Epoch Five, Six, Seven, etc.
Karma GAP impact criteria: Following being funded, project's will be expected to set up and update their project's Karma GAP profile.

Karma GAP Impact Criteria
You'll notice in the reporting requirements you're requested to include a link to your project's Karma GAP (opens new window). We ask that you fill out the Milestones and Impact Criteria. If you have broader reaching milestones (>3 months), we ask that you break it down into smaller milestones. Then have separate bigger milestones that you can reference. Please include sources of truth, such as links.
